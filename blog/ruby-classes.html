        This week at Dev Bootcamp we focused a lot on classes. Classes are an awesome way to organize data. You assign the data different attributes and pass the information within methods.  It's easier here if I let the code do the talking.
      </p>
      <pre><code>
        class Movie
          def initialize(actor, director, title)
            @actor = actor
            @director = director
            @title = title
          end

          def movie_title
            puts "#{@title} was a really great movie!"
          end

          def the_talent
            puts "It starred #{@actor}"
          end

          def directed
            puts "And it was directed by #{@director}.  #{@actor} has been in some other films by #{@director} in the past as well."
          end
        end


      movie= Movie.new("Owen Wilson", "Wes Anderson", "The Royal Tenenbaums")
      movie.movie_title
      movie.the_talent
      movie.directed

      </code></pre>

      <p>
        Above you see a gorgeous and complicated example of me creating, defining and calling a class. (Okay, it's basic). First I defined a classs titled Movie, with a capital 'M'. It is important to use a capital letter to define class.  A class must do something meaningful. You add methods to interact with the data and give results. Methods are just things that an object can do.
      </p>
      <p>
        The next step is to initialize the method which will pass down all parameters to use in any other method of the class. Pretty nifty, huh? These are our instance variables. Instance variables are defined with an <code>@</code> symbol. Instance variables represent an object's data and object ID. If the variable doesn't begin with an <code>@</code> it is just a plain old local variable that can't be used between methods.
      </p>
      <p>
        The last step is to call the method.  <code>movie= Movie.new("Owen Wilson", "Wes Anderson", "The Royal Tenenbaums")</code> is creating a new instance of the class Movie. To call each individual method of the class we just type <code>move.'method_name'</code> and fill in the correct name of the method.

        This week marks the end of Phase 0! Holy cow, how did that happen so fast?! I am getting increasingly nervous for Phase 1, but cannot wait to begin a career as a developer.
      </p>
      <p>
        One of my favorite tasks of Phase 0 has been building my person website and tech blog. I have such a love for HTML/CSS and I cannot wait to learn more about it.  I have made a couple of simple sites in the past, like <a href="http://www.birdiethebulldog.com">this</a> one for my BFF Birdie, but my personal site is the most hands-on I have been with a webpage thus far.  I went through a few redesigns, definitely hit some walls here and there, but I am happy with the current result.
      </p>
      <p>
        While it was hard for me to decide on a final layout, I learned to make a plan and see it through. It's easy to get caught in a loop of changes and indecision, but I find it is best to work through your current plan, be flexible, and realize that you can always make changes in the end.
    </p>
    <p>
      There is still a lot of work to do on my site, and I am looking forward to implementing more JavaScript as well as a better mobile version.
      Next time you guys hear from me I will be living a new life as an onsite DBC student. Wish me luck!

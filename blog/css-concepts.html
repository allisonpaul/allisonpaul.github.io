Positioning with CSS.
    Why won't this stay where I put it?

Elements
Let's start with the basics. An element is an individual component of a web page, or the basic building block of HTML. Most elements are written with a start tag and an end tag with content inbetween. They can be nested within each other to describe the structure of the page.

I should also note that it is common to group elements together in a containing element, such as < div >. Grouping elements allows you to format them using less CSS code.

The Position of Elements

The position property has four common values that are supported in all browsers: static, relative, absolute, or fixed. These allow you to edit the layout of your page.

Static Positioning

Static positioning is the normal flow of the web page. If you don't apply another position value to your element, it will default to static. Statically positioned elements will stack on top of one another. You do not need to define the position as static, however you could with

  box {
  position:static
  }

This layout is helpful for a simple, single column pages where everything stacks on top of each other.

Relative Positioning

Relative positioning stacks items nicely as well but gives you some freedom to move the elements around. This scheme moves an element in relation to where it would have been in the static flow. You can move it using the offset properties, left, right, top, or bottom.

  box {
  position:relative;
  top:15px;
  left:15px;
}

The example above takes the box element and moves it down and to the left of the other elements on the page, but leaves it in the normal flow.

Absolute Positioning

Absolute positioning is perhaps the trickiest. When an element is given the propert of absolute, it is taken out of the normal flow of the page and acts like the other elements aren't there. If you tell an element to go somewhere with absolute positioning, there it will stay.
Just like in relative positioning, you use the offset properites move an element around.

  box {
    position:absolute;
    top:15px;
    left:15px;
    }

This bit of code looks very similar to the block we used about, however it would result in a very different layout.
Since the position is set as absolute, the top and bottom values that we set would take the box element and place it exactly 15px from the top and 15px from the left. There it will stay, regardless of what elements are in its path. You can also set a width property to avoid any overlapping elements.


Fixed Positioning

Fixed positioning is a type of absolute positioning. It shares all the same rules, except the element is positioned in relation to the browser window. When a user scrolls down the page the element will be in the exact same place- it won't scroll with you.
Again, you use the offset properties to set your position. This is useful when you want to have an ever-present navigation bar on your page.

      <h2>How and Why You Should Use Version Control</h2>

      <H3>The Importance</h3>
        <p>
        I really cannot stress enough the importance of version control (and neither can the internet, because this stuff is everywhere).  Version control is like a virtual file system for multiple versions of whatever you are working on. It records changes over time and stores them so you can revert back to files in a previous state and view the entire history of revisions. Say you and a teammate are working on the same file and want to upload it to review. Well, you both need to save the file without overwriting the other persons version.  With version control you can do this and then later merge them together into one master document. Version control also provides the added comfort of being easily able to recover files if you screw up. And let's face it- we all screw up.

      <h3>Git With It</h3>
        <p>
        To use version control you need to become familar with git. Git is the software that equips files with version control and is controlled using the command line.  Go ahead and install git on your local machine in the command line using<br>

        <b>git config --global user.name "Your Name Here"</b><br>

        Once you fill in your email address you are an offical git user. Congrats.
        </p>

        <p>
        When you create a new directory it's just a plain folder until you initialize git.  You do this one of two ways; with the <b>git init</b> command or by cloning a repository from GitHub using <b>git clone</b> followed by the URL of the repo you are cloning.
        I'm so proud, you have made your first git repository!
        While git tracks if you edit, move, or create new files, it does not automatically save these changes. You must manually create save points known as commits via the command line.
        </p>

      <h3>Lets commit</h3>
        <p>
        Now that you have initalized or cloned a git repository, it is essential to create a new branch, or a seperate log of commits, to avoid messing with any source code.
        To do this you use <b>git branch -b name_of_your_branch</b>.
        You will do all of your work in this branch until you are ready to merge with what is called the master branch, or the folder where you will keep all the stable, production-ready code. When you are ready to commit use the <b>git add</b> command.  This will move your files to a staging area, and you will then finalize the commit with <b> git commit -m "a message about your commit here"</b>. Putting a message with your commit is really important as you need to tell those you are working with the change that was made, why it was made, who it was made by, and when it was made.  Even if you are working alone on the project, by the end it will probably have hundreds of commits and you need something to show you why each commit was made and what the change in the file was.  A good commit message it short -less than 50 characters, specific, begins with a capital letter, and in the imperative.
        Make sure to delete the feature branch both on Github and locally once everything is merged.

      <h3>Github</h3>
        <p>
        Now that we've learned the what git is and the basics of how to use it, let's talk about GitHub.  GitHub is an awesome resource that allows you to store your repositories in the cloud.  It's really crucial that you have your content saved somewhere other than your machine, as you never know what kind of disaster can occur and then poof, all your hard work is gone. GitHub ensures that your code is safe and can be accessed from other machines.
        </p>
        <p>
        In addition to storing code, GitHub allows developers to share and edit projects.  It's great when you are working in teams because all members can upload their feature branches and review them from their local machines before merging to the master branch.
        </p>
        <p>
        GitHub is a great social network. You can look at what others are working on, make suggestions or changes,and collaborate.

      <h3>Cheat Sheet </h3>
        <p>
        There is much more to cover when discussing git and Github but I'm going to give you guys some basic git commands.

        <br>
        <b>git init</b>-intializes a new git repository<br>
        <b>git status</b>-checks the status of your repository. Shows you which files have been change, staged, or if no changes have been made.  Also shows if you are in sync with the master branch on Github.
        <br>
        <b>git branch</b>- shows all of the branches and what branch you are currently working in.<br>
        <b>git add</b>-stages the files for commit. creates a snapshot of the file.
        <br>
        <b>git commit</b>-adds the files to the repository
        <br>
        <b>git checkout</b>-allows you to navigate between branchs.  just type the name of the branch after the command to move to that repo.
        <br>
        <b>git push</b>-when you are ready to combine your changes with your master branch in GitHub you will use this command to push your changes up to the cloud.
        <br>
        <b>git pull</b>-If someone has made changes to the repository in GitHub this command will pull the latest version to your local machine.

<!--How was it to wireframe and create an HTML page with a pair?
      It was really nice doing this with a pair! We were able to bounce questions off of each other about sections and headers, and got along well.

Did you find wireframing to be helpful to your development process?
    Wireframing was better working with a pair than by myself I would say.  It's helpful we a pair because it gets you on the same page, and you can march forward with a layout in mind.  When you are working on a website for yourself it seems to be more of a challenge to wireframe.  For me at least, since I constantly wanted to edit my frame with a new design.

What did you and your pair decide made a good wireframe?
    We decided clear sections and a nav bar made for a good wiregrame for this challenge.  Ours is simple, with a header, a blog post title, blog post date, blog content and a small nav bar with a link to the home page as well as the blog index page.
    We also thought adding social media links in the footer was nice.
What new semantic elements did you learn about (if any)?
    We didn't go over any new semantic elements, but we did discuss the difference between the head and header elements.  -->

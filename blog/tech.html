      <h1>The Internet and the World Wide Web</h1>
         <h2>A Simple Introduction</h2>

        The internet makes up a HUGE part of our lives.  We all use it.  We all love it.  We definitely couldn't live without it.  But how does it work?
      </p>
      <p>
        For simplicity and understanding, let's look at the internet as two main components.  First, there is hardware.  This includes computers, cables, routers, modems, cell phone towers, smart phones, and all other devices that work together to help create a network.
      </p>
      <p>
        The second component are protocols or sets of rules that machines follow to complete tasks. All of the machines connected to the internet have a common set of rules and procedures to make the internet run.  They all must be able to understand each other and send information.  Without protocols you would need direct connections to other devices to access the information they hold.
      </p>
      <h3>The World Wide Web</h3>
      <p>
        The internet is often confused with the World Wide Web, but these two things are not synonymous.  While the internet is the collection of the many different protocols and hardware, the World Wide Web is one of those different protocols.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Wen contains a large collection of linked multimedia pages, ever growing and changing.  As I have learned, there are several different components of the Web that allow users to communicate with each other.
          <ul>
            <li>
              <b>TCP/IP protocols</b>- With these protocols virtually all computers can communicate with each other.</li>
            <li><b>Domain name system</b>-An Internet address has numbers that are separated by dots, or an IP address that serves as an identifier. Rather than have the user remember long strings of numbers, the Domain Name System (DNS) was developed to translate the numerical addresses into words. Can you imagine having to type in http://74.125.224.72/ everytime you wanted to go to Google's homepage?
            </li>
            <li><b>URLS</b>- The addresses for websites are called URLS or Uniform Resource Locators. Most of them begin with http:// (HyperText Transfer Protocol).
            </li>
            <li><b>Top-level domain</b>- This is the last field of the domain na,e and it describes the type of organization (and sometimes country) that is associated with the address. <br>
              .com- Commerical<br>
              .edu- Eduational<br>
              .gov- US Government<br>
              .int- Organization<br>
              .mil- US Miliatry<br>
              .net- Networking Providers<br>
              .org- Non-profit Organization<br>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
          The internet is a fascinating tool and I hope to continue my learning of it's foundation and interworkings.  I will keep you updated!

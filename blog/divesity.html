                "Only 11% of all engineers in the U.S. are women, according to Department of Labor. The situation is a better among computer programmers, but not much. Women account for only 26% of all American coders." - Wired

                The diversity in tech issue has been shining in a new light ever since fall of 2014 when Google released their <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/2014/05/28/google-releases-employee-diversity-figures/9697049/">diversity report</a>. This report showed that 83% of Google's tech workers were males. Overall, the company was 61% white, 30% Asian, 3% Hispanic, and 2% African American. I mean wow, that's a lot of white dudes in the tech industry. These findings sparked numerous initiatives to diversify tech companies, but how have they progessed thus far, and why was this a problem to begin with?

          <h2>The Pipeline</h2>
            <p>
              Many hold the "pipeline" belief that this gender gap is a result of the lack of girls studying math and science. Studies from the National Girls Collaborative Project report findings that girls are taking high level math and science courses at similar rates as their males peers. On a collegiate level there is a drop off and while the majority of degree holders both overall and in science in general, are women, significantly less women are obtaining degress in computer science and engineering than men.
              We see that this gap is there. It's clear that there is an issue but what can be done to solve it? Do we spend more time trying to persuade girls and women to choose a tech education, which will hopefully result in a career in the tech industry?
              Well, of course we need to get young girls interesting in math and science. We need to praise them for this course of action and offer incentives for pursing it, but while this in an important step it is ultimatly really not enough.  By focusing just on the pipeline issue we don't hold current companies responsible for their culture and we ignore the question of "Where are the women today?!"

          <h2>Office Culture </h2>
            <p>
              Google was the first company to acknowledge an unconscious racial and gender bias in the tech industry that is leading companies to hire more white men. Perhaps this is also leading to less pay for women and minorites, which may cause them to quit.
               Many large tech companies, such as Google and Facebook, now hold trainings to try to deal with and crush unconcious bias.
            </p>
            <p>
              A recent report release January 2016,  <a href="http://elephantinthevalley.com/">Elephant in the Valley</a>, analyzes the state of women in Silicon Valley and shows really disappointing results. They polled over 200 women in the bay area, focusing on those with at least 10 years experience. Here's a quick run down of some of those results:
                <ul>
                  <li>84% have been told they are too aggressive</li>
                  <li>66% have felt excluded from key social or networking opportunities because of their gender </li>
                  <li>88% have experienced clients or colleagues addressing questions to male peers that should be addressed to them</li>
                  <li>75% were asked about marital status and children in interviews</li>
                  <li>60% of women reported unwanted sexual advances</li>
                  <li>60% of those who reported sexual harassment were unhappy with the course of action</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p>
              I mean, wow. How can we not acknowledge this an unconscious bias that could very well lead to women quitting their jobs in the tech industry?  We need to take steps to make women more comfortable in tech.  These steps range from hiring practices to in-office behavior that shows women that are valued, equal employees.

          <h2>Do We Blame the Culture?</h2>
           <p>
            An important step is to recognize that increasing the diversity in the tech issue is not just an issue for the women, but an issue for all humans, for the tech industry as a whole, and honestly just all industries in general.
          </p>
          <p>
          Companies must continue to track progress and publish data regarding not only hiring numbers of women and minorities, but interviewing numbers as well.
          Publishing goals holds companies accountable for making meaningful changes. If companies are open about their sucesses and failures, other's can learn from them and perhaps take on their model.

What did you learn about CSS padding, borders, and margin by doing this challenge?


  I used padding a lot in my sites.  I have colored sections on my home page to help make distinct sections for page jumps and I always used padding to get the elements correctly positioned within the section. I actually used padding more than margin in all of my pages, since it achieved the look I was going for.  Padding adds space within the content box and margin adds space on the outside.



What did you learn about CSS positioning?


 I learned a lot about positioning, especially since I used columns for my blog index. I learned that absolute positioning in a complete headache that messes up my scrolling,  ha!
  I learned to make a 'sticky' footer with fixed positioning.


What aspects of your design did you find easiest to implement? What was most difficult?


  It was easiest to implement colors, fonts, sizes but it was really hard to position things.  Footers were giving me a really hard time for a while until I stumbled on the article about sticky footers.  I could't get things centered on to stay in the right position when scrolling.  I also had a hard time with my index.html images.  When the window is minimized they move into the section below.  This drove me crazy and I eventually had to just throw in the towel. I think this might be an issue for javascript.


What did you learn about adding and formatting elements with CSS in this challenge?


  I learned that classes and IDs are my friends. I used IDS a lot to format my information. I also learned to try to be concise with my formatting and not have a lot of IDs when I can group with one.

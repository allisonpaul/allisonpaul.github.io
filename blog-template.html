<!--How was it to wireframe and create an HTML page with a pair?
      It was really nice doing this with a pair! We were able to bounce questions off of each other about sections and headers, and got along well.

Did you find wireframing to be helpful to your development process?
    Wireframing was better working with a pair than by myself I would say.  It's helpful we a pair because it gets you on the same page, and you can march forward with a layout in mind.  When you are working on a website for yourself it seems to be more of a challenge to wireframe.  For me at least, since I constantly wanted to edit my frame with a new design.

What did you and your pair decide made a good wireframe?
    We decided clear sections and a nav bar made for a good wiregrame for this challenge.  Ours is simple, with a header, a blog post title, blog post date, blog content and a small nav bar with a link to the home page as well as the blog index page.
    We also thought adding social media links in the footer was nice.
What new semantic elements did you learn about (if any)?
    We didn't go over any new semantic elements, but we did discuss the difference between the head and header elements.  -->
